        When Deliveroo's founder and CEO Will Shu moved to London in 2013 he
        discovered a city full of great restaurants, but he was amazed that so
        few of them delivered food. He made it his personal mission to bring the
        best local restaurants direct to people’s doors. Today, Deliveroo
        operates a hyperlocal three-sided marketplace, connecting local
        consumers, restaurants and grocers, and riders to fulfill a mission
        critical, emotional purchase in under 30 minutes. By offering fast and
        reliable delivery which consumers can track online, Deliveroo has grown
        rapidly. Deliveroo now operates in 11 markets worldwide, working with
        thousands of restaurants and grocers, thousands of riders, and serving
        millions of consumers. For our latest news visit the newsroom

        Food delivery is a hyperlocal business. We think about our offer to
        consumers on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood level. We have spent years
        working to understand what consumers want and establishing a proposition
        that can be adapted to appeal to every neighbourhood and consumer – from
        students, to professionals or families, and from city centres to
        suburbs, commuter belts and small towns. Everyone eats and Deliveroo has
        an offer that reflects what people across every neighbourhood want. Our
        proposition to consumers aims to always provide the best availability,
        selection, experience and value, whilst also building an emotional
        connection with our brand.

        Since 2013, we have grown to now work with 160,000 restaurant and
        grocery partners. We started as a restaurant food-delivery service,
        working with national dining chains as well as local, independent
        favourites. Our service unlocked delivery for over 90% of the partners
        on our platform – businesses that never previously offered delivery. Our
        model has dramatically expanded the number of restaurants that can offer
        delivery and as a result it has opened up new food options for consumers
        around the world. In 2018, given our ambition to build the definitive
        online food company, we started adding grocery partners to our platform
        with an on-demand grocery service built on the same technology that
        drives our core logistics-enabled restaurants marketplace. Today, we
        work with some of the largest grocery retailers in the world, including
        Co-op, Conad, Carrefour, Casino, Marks and Spencer, Picard, Waitrose,
        and Whole Foods Market.

        We build our proposition for riders based on the things they tell us
        they value most. This understanding of what riders care about most has
        helped us to develop an offer that prioritises the things they value:
        flexible work, good earnings and security. Deliveroo was amongst the
        first food delivery platforms to provide free personal accident and
        third-party liability insurance to all self-employed riders globally.
        This cover is provided free of charge and protects riders from their
        very first order with Deliveroo. Our founder and CEO, Will, was the very
        first rider and worked doing deliveries full time for the first year of
        running the business. Along with team members right across Deliveroo, he
        still completes deliveries regularly today.

        Deliveroo has built technology to enable us to simultaneously complete
        hundreds of thousands of orders right across the globe – in a way that
        is intuitive and reliable for riders, restaurants and grocers. Our
        technology has opened up new opportunities for restaurant and grocery
        partners to grow their businesses through delivery, often for the first
        time; for riders to access flexible work opportunities; and to
        ultimately deliver a great experience for consumers. Deliveroo's
        pioneering logistics technology is based on intelligent machine learning
        which allows us to continually improve the nuances of delivering
        neighbourhood by neighbourhood. Deliveroo deploys technology, such as
        our Frank algorithm, to find the best way of connecting riders,
        restaurants, and customers to deliver a best-in-class logistics service.
        Frank is continuously improving its knowledge-learning capabilities,
        such as how long it takes a restaurant to prepare a meal to the time it
        takes to travel a certain route at different times of the day, to make
        the service even more efficient.

        Deliveroo is passionate about food and bringing people evermore choice.
        But Deliveroo’s mission is not only to make sure that the restaurants
        and grocers in your area are available to you when and where you want
        them - we want to go further and bring new restaurants to your area so
        you have even more choice of amazing food. Deliveroo’s delivery-only
        kitchens concept, ‘Editions’, is an innovation we pioneered that helps
        restaurants expand to new areas at lower cost and with lower risk. We
        help restaurants to set up delivery-only kitchens in new areas without
        the upfront costs of a high-street premise. Deliveroo provides
        restaurants with data insights so that they know which cuisines will be
        popular in specific local areas - meaning restaurants grow faster and
        customers have wider choice. Deliveroo is also investing in expanding
        our on-demand grocery service, offering delivery from national
        supermarkets as well as providing rapid delivery from our own network of
        delivery-only sites, called Deliveroo ‘Hop’, which is being rolled out
        in several markets
